# cs544-usc

This repo contains my coursework for NLP at USC.
CS544 covered an overview of NLP topics such as information extraction,
word embeddings, QA, NLI, machine translation, etc. We also gained a mastery of statistical (e.g., HMM, Naive Bayes) and state-of-the-art neural methods (e.g., BERT series, GRU, etc.) used in language technologies.


## Coding assignments
Here, I provide a very brief overview of hw's completed. For more info, see the specific README's in the respective folders.
1. Naive Bayes
	* Tasked to write a Naive Bayes classifier (from scratch) for sentiment analysis.

* HW2 - Hidden markov models
	* Develop a Hidden Markov Model part-of-speech tagger (from scratch) that works for any language.

* HW3 - Ciphertext classification
	* Tasked with a simple scenario for privacy-preserving NLU: developing a text classification model based on ciphertext.

* HW4 - Precondition inference
	* Develop a natural language reasoner to decide whether a precondition will enable or disable a statement.
